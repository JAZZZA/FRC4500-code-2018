  Somebody once told me the world was gonna roll me
  I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
  She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
  In the shape of Rupal on her forehead
  Barney is a dinosaur from our imagination
And when he's tall
He's what we call a dinosaur sensation
Barney's friends are big and small
They come from lots of places
After school they meet to play
And sing with happy faces
Barney shows us lots of things
Like how to play pretend
ABC's, and 123's
And how to be a friend
Barney comes to play with us
Whenever we may need him
Barney can be your friend too
If you just make-believe him!
